# ProjectTile
Sample application for basic tracking of client-based projects

This is a sample project I created to learn C# code, and then show what I can do. It isn't perfect and there are definitely some aspects of the code that could be tidied up, which I may look into in future. It also doesn't include all of the functionality I had planned, but again hopefully I'll find time to add that in at a later date..

This is a Visual C# project created in Visual Studio 2013. The application uses a SQL Server database (I used SSMS 2014), which I've hosted on AWS. You can create a local version by running the SQL scripts, then changing the App.Config settings to point to your database.
